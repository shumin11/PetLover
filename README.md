# PetLover


## Description

This project is a social network for puppy lovers, allowing them to share updates, photos, and stores about their adorable pets. Users can create profiles, post content, and connect with like-minded individuals. We use SQL databases and Flask to manage the data and build the platform. Donations are accepted through Stripe integrated with Flask. Our goal is to create a vibrant community for puppy enthusiasts while supporting puppy welfare through donations.
